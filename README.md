# NuBuildGDX
NuBuildGDX is a fork of BuildGDX aiming for stability, bug fixing and performance improvements.

My goal is to get it in good shape for long term availability and support.  I will also be personally maintaining some dependencies for this as some parts are very deeply intertwined with API versions and I don't trust upstream projects to not keep changing API's every release they do.

For renderer's, the PolyGDX and Classic ones will be removed.  PolyGDX's performance is atrocious and Classic is basically unplayable due to its poor frametime graph (many micro stutters).  Polymost is the best, smoothest and to be honest, the only one you should be using.

# Summary
Reduce the bloat, increase the stability..  basically.
