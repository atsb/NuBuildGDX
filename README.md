# NuBuildGDX
NuBuildGDX is a fork of BuildGDX aiming for stability, bug fixing and performance improvements.

My goal is to get it in good shape for long term availability and support.  I will also be personally maintaining some dependencies for this as some parts are very deeply intertwined with API versions and I don't trust upstream projects to not keep changing API's every release they do.

For renderer's, an improved classic renderer is the only option.

# Summary
Reduce the bloat, increase the stability..  basically.
